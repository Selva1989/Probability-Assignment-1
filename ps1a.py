    """
    Uses a greedy heuristic to determine an allocation of cows that attempts to
    minimize the number of spaceship trips needed to transport all the cows. The
    returned allocation of cows may or may not be optimal.
    The greedy heuristic should follow the following method:

    1. As long as the current trip can fit another cow, add the largest cow that will fit
        to the trip
    2. Once the trip is full, begin a new trip to transport the remaining cows

    limit - weight limit of the spaceship (an int)
    
    Returns:
    A list of lists, with each inner list containing the names of cows

def brute_force_cow_transport(cows,limit=10):
    """
    Finds the allocation of cows that minimizes the number of spaceship trips
    via brute force.  The brute force algorithm should follow the following method:

    1. Enumerate all possible ways that the cows can be divided into separate trips 
        Use the given get_partitions function in ps1_partition.py to help you!
    2. Select the allocation that minimizes the number of trips without making any trip
